Stores the hashed password from the database.

php

if (password_verify($password, $hashedpwd))
Verifies if the submitted password matches the hashed one in the database using password_verify().

php

$_SESSION['username'] = $row['username'];
$_SESSION['email'] = $email;

header("Location: index.php");

php

else {
    echo "incorrect Password";
}
If password verification fails, this shows an error.

php
Copy
Edit
else {
    echo "<script>alert('No user found with this email!'); window.location.href='login.php';</script>";
}
If no user is found with the entered email, shows an alert and redirects back to login.
