Knowing the file system helps you customize, fix, build, and control your site

1. Customization
To change the design or layout, you need to know where theme files are.

Example: Want to edit the homepage? Go to wp-content/themes/your-theme/front-page.php
-----------------------------------------------

2. Fixing Errors
If your site breaks, knowing the file structure helps you find the problem fast.

Example: Turn on debugging in wp-config.php
-----------------------------------------------

3. Security
You’ll know which files to back up or protect.

Example: Keep wp-content/uploads/ safe — it has all your images.
-----------------------------------------------

4. Build Your Own Stuff
If you're making themes or plugins, you need to know where to put your code.

Example: Custom plugin? Add it inside wp-content/plugins/
-----------------------------------------------

5. Better Control
You can speed up your site, clean it, and manage it better.

Example: Edit .htaccess for performance or SEO.
